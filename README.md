# My-Journey-with-Python
A working documentation of the skills and tools I am gaining with Python. Most work has been done through a Master's program.

 ### M3-1.ipynb   
  * Created a pandas data-frame with specific columns.   
  * Used groupby() function to show mean values.   
  * Presented descriptive statistics for the data-frame.   
  * Created a second data-frame and merged it with the first along a common factor.  
    
### M4_1.ipynb   
  * Utilized the Pandas functions head() and tail() to create two data-frames with a 70:30 train/test split, with top 70% in one df and lower 30% in the other.   
  * Utilized the Pandas function sample() and drop() to create two data-frames with a random 70:30 train/test split.  
  * Incorporated the Scikit-learn package to create two data-frames with a random 70:30 train/test split.  
      
 ### M5.1.ipynb  
  * Using a data file, created a specified data-frame and performed a random 70:30 train/test split.  
  * From the train df, created and plotted a decision tree model.  
  * From the test df, showed a confusion matrix and model accuracy.  
  * Reapeated for another specified df, documenting changes. 
      
### M5.2.ipynb  
  * Created a decision tree to find the relatiobship between dependent variable Y and independent variables X0 and X1.  
    
### M6_1.ipynb 
  * Pulled specified data from an Excel file to create random 75:25 train/test data-frames.  
  * Through K-means clustered train df into two clusters.  
  * Plotted a scatter plot before and after K-means clustering.  
  * Predicted cluster labels for test df using the predict() function.  
      
### M6_2.ipynb  
  * Created a scatter plot for a dataset.  
  * Clustered data into three clusters using K-means, and created another scatter plot.  
    
### Module 8_1.ipynb  
  * Extracted specified information from tweets following a specified keyword and stored them into an excel file without an index.  
  * Reapeated process for another specified keyword.  
      
### Module 8_2.ipynb 
  * Extracted and loaded specified information from tweets containaing a keyword into a dataframe.  
    
### M9_1.ipynb  
  * Extracted and loaded specified information from over 100 tweets containaing a keyword into dataframes.  
  * Combined the dataframes into one master df.  
      
### M9_2.ipynb 
  * Extracted data from specified tweet data utilizing the Shelve package to create a dataframe.
